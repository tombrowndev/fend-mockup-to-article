<h1>Mockup To Article</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

For this prject, I had to create a html article from an image mock-up. The article was supplied in pure text, within an existing html template, and I was required to add the correct tags and elements to exactly match the mock-up.

<h2>Reflections</h2>

As an experienced developer, I found this task easy to complete, and without any major stumbling blocks. 

I did, however, learn a lesson in having to choose from multiple solutions that seemed to do the same thing. I found this when using bold text and deleted text. I used the MDN Reference to learn about the subtle differences between for example, <b> and <strong>.

I also had to recap on whether it's recommended to close an image tag with or without the closing slash. I used Stack Overflow to check this and found that the short close tag is recommended.

Overall, this was an easy task for me to complete.
